### GUI :
  The graphical user interface is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as    primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.
### Tkinter :
  Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included  with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python.
